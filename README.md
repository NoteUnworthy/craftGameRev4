This is a simple crafting game made to the best of my current ability.
It may not be large and in depth but after spending countless hours learning new things methods and syntax,
I am still extremely proud of all I have accomplished to make this.

This text-based console game, consists of a simple material gathering aspect with the ability to combine
collected materials.

You can exit the game/console at anytime by typing !exit but be aware this doesn't save your game and
can sometimes interrupt the program. As a result I would recommend leaving the game through the main menu.

There are various troubleshooting methods in regard to keeping a user on the right track, I have set
this out so the user can follow the menu in a 1-2-3 method should they choose. The specification was
for the game to be aimed at a younger audience after all.

Admittedly this game does differ from the original brief that I presented with the group during the
assignment 010. I personally struggled with calling and retaining information across various classes
and went through entire revisions of this game approximately 3 times over. Had I had more time I would
still like to incorporate what my group peers would have liked to call the "science mode" however allowing
an array to be updated across the various menu options proved very difficult, so I opted to have it
centralised in the 'runNewGame' method. I managed to accomplish various other tasks like adding/removing
items the user has collected and used to make items and incorporating a levelling system to track the progress.

In conclusion, I am over the moon with how this project has gone so far and intend to carry on expanding this
in my free time for my own pleasure.

I would lastly like to say that since the beginning of this class I had never touched JAVA programming.
When my group and I were making the presentation I tried to keep it simple but that didn't work out, as I result
this shows for me in this program.

Thank you for trying this and I hope you enjoy the Intelligent Craft Game.
